Chapters should organize well-rounded programs and strive for excellence and quality in all undertakings. The Fraternity should promote ethical behavior and decision-making. The lessons taught from Fraternity ritual should be incorporated into the daily lives of the members. Kappa Sigmas are expected to act as gentlemen at all times, and the Fraternity must demand the highest standards of personal conduct. The Fraternity should instill a sense of responsibility and integrity. The dignity of all persons shall always be respected; intolerant or abusive behavior cannot be tolerated. The Fraternity should encourage service to others. Members, individually and collectively, should work toward the betterment of their campus and community... and in so doing contribute to the betterment of themselves."

Lambda Chi Alpha was an on campus fraternity at Chico State through the 1990's until it faced some issues and was forced to close its doors in the early 2000's. In the fall of 2013, a group of Chico state undergraduate students began operating as the interest group Omicron Alpha Pi behind the belief that with dedication and perseverance they could come together with the common goal of re-colonizing Lambda Chi Alpha here at Chico State. The interest group grew in size and brotherhood, and after one full year in operation as ""OAP"", nationals agreed to return to Chico and appeal to the IFC board on campus who voted to allow the organization to return to the university. Heading into Fall of 2015 the colony is now composed of 65 active members and is preparing to present for their charter. The re-colonization of Lambda Chi Alpha is based on the mission of building good men into great men, and for its brothers to uphold the fraternity's 7 core values in order to better their lives and the lives of those around them."

M.E.Ch.A was founded on the principles of self-determination for the liberation of our people. We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society. Each word in M.E.Ch.A symbolizes a great concept in terms of la causa (the cause). Movimiento means that the organization is dedicated to the movement to gain self-determination for our people. Estudiantil, identifies the organization as a student group for we are part of our community's future. At the heart of the name is the use of the identity: Chicanx. At first seen as a derogatory word, now taken for a badge of honor. In adopting their new identity, the students committed themselves to return to the barrios, colonias, or campos and together, struggle against the forces that oppress our people. Lastly, the affirmation that we are Indigenous people to this land by placing our movement in Aztlan, the homeland of all peoples from Anahuak. We are self aware that the term Aztlán is problematic in itself. The Aztlán ideology reinforces the idea that the Mexica originated in this territory and therefore it rightfully belongs to them. What this fails to address is that this land does not belong to the Mexica, but belongs to other tribes besides the Mexica. On campuses across Aztlan, M.E.Ch.A and MEChistAs are often the only groups on campus raza and non-raza alike that seek to open the doors of higher education for our communities and strive for a society free of imperialism, racism, sexism, and homophobia. An inspirational statement in El Plan Santa Barbara that speaks to this notes: ""M.E.Ch.A must bring to the mind of every young Chicana and Chicano that the liberation of her/his people from prejudice and oppression is in her/his hands and this responsibility is greater than personal achievement and more meaningful than degrees, especially if they are earned at the expense of her/his identity and cultural integrity. M.E.Ch.A, then, is more than a name; it is a spirit of unity, of sisterhood and brotherhood, and a resolve to undertake a struggle for liberation in society where justice is but a word. M.E.Ch.A is a means to an end"" (El Plan de Santa Barbara). Follow our Social Media Pages to get a Visual to what we are all about (Click the upper right icons.)"

They wanted to establish a student organization to help improve the recruitment and retention of black engineering students. In the late 1960's, a devastating 80 percent of the black freshmen entering the engineering program dropped out. The dean agreed to the idea and assigned the only black faculty member on staff, Arthur J. Bond, as advisor. Barnett served as the first president of the BSE. The fledging group gained momentum in 1974, with the direction and encouragement of Bond and the active participation of the young men whose destiny was to become the founders of NSBE. Now known as the ""Chicago Six"", these men are Anthony Harris, Brian Harris, Stanley L. Kirtley, John W. Logan, Jr., Edward A. Coleman, and George A. Smith. Encouraged by their on-campus success, Anthony Harris, president of the Purdue chapter, wrote a letter to the presidents and deans of every accredited engineering program in the country (288), explained the Society of Black Engineers (SBE) concept and asked them to identify black student leaders, organizations and faculty members who might support their efforts on a national basis. Approximately 80 schools responded. Many had similar Black student organizations with similar objectives. A date was set for the first national meeting and 48 students representing 32 schools attended the event, held April 10-12, 1975. Harris also changed the organizations' nomenclature from the BSE to the Society of Black Engineers (SBE). It was at that historic meeting through majority vote, that SBE became the National Society of Black Engineers. The familiar NSBE symbol ""N"" with lightning bolts was chosen and it remains a distinctively recognizable symbol representing the premier technical organization for African American engineering students and professionals. NSBE was eventually incorporated in Texas, in 1976 as 501©3 non-profit organization. John Cason, also of Purdue, served as the first elected president of NSBE. As the organization grew, Virginia Booth became the first female National Chairperson and the first to serve two terms 1978-1980. The torch symbolizes members' everlasting, burning desire to achieve success in a competitive society and positively affect the quality of life for all people. The lightening bolt represents the striking impact that will be felt by the society and industry due to the contributions and accomplishments made by the dedicated members of the National Society of Black Engineers. NSBE has since grown from six to over 31,000 members and the annual meeting has blossomed into the Annual National Convention, hosting over 8,000 attendees. NSBE has 99 active NSBE Jr. pre-college, 250 student and 68 professional chapters. Headquartered in Alexandria, Va., NSBE offers academic excellence programs, scholarships, leadership training, professional development and access to career opportunities for thousands of members annually. With over 2000 elected leadership positions, 18 regional conferences and an annual convention, NSBE provides opportunities for success that remain unmatched by any other organization."

""Multiculturalism is an appreciation of the different cultures in our sorority and around us; an acknowledgment of the different values and equality of diverse groups."" We are based on Academics, Community service and Sisterhood with an emphasis on multiculturalism. Our sorority offers an atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Without an education we would not be where we are today. We encourage academic success by implementing study hours. We try to educate ourselves as well as others in the community by making ourselves and others aware of issues that concern the community and by offering our services in an effort to help make the community we live in a better one. We are involved with various campus events. As a sister of Upsilon Kappa Delta you can always count on finding someone who will stick by your side through thick and thin. Our motto ""A Sisterhood 2 Tight 2 Break"" says it all. By the same token,a sister must dedicate her heart and her soul to the letters we proudly earned to wear across our chest.
